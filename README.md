functions, local and global scope (p.77 1-14 checked into Github, checked by group)

1.) Functions group code that gets executed multiple times. Without a function you would have to copy and paste code each time so you do not have to duplicate code.

2.) Code in function executes when the function is Called.

3.) def statement creates a function.

4.) A function has the def statement in it and contains code within the def statement.
    A function call executes the function and evaluates it down to a value.

5.) There is only one Global scope. There can be multiple Local scopes and they are created whenever there is a function called.

6.) When the function call returns in a local scope the variables are destroyed.

7.) Return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. It can be used as a part of an expression.

8.) None.

9.) A Global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable.

10.) NoneType

11.) imports module areallyourpetsnamederic

12.) spam.bacon()

13.) By adding a line of code that might cause an error in the try clause.

14.) Put code that could potentially have an error in the try clause.
The except clause contains code to handle what happens when the error occurs.
